SQL Homework - Employee Database: A Mystery in Two Parts

# Background
It is a beautiful spring day, and it is two weeks since you have been hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard. Your first major task is a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remain of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.

  * Data Engineering
  * Data Analysis

# Epilogue
